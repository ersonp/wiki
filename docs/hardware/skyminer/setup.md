Depending on your experience / technical know-how you can:

- Use [Skybian](https://github.com/skycoin/skybian) via the Skyimager by following the [Skyimager User Guide](https://github.com/skycoin/skywire/wiki/Skyimager-User-Guide) to get up and running (preferred option, very easy & straightforward)
- Install Skywire [from source](../../../software/skywire/setup/overview). This option requires previous technical experience but will give you a better understanding of how your official Skyminer is configured.

After the registration please make sure to registrate your Skyminer on the [Skywire Whitelisting System](https://whitelist.skycoin.com/) ([user guide](../../../software/skywire/userdocs/whitelisting))
