# Personalizing your Skywallet

After completing the initialization of your Skywallet, you can start to personalize your Skywallet using the Desktop Wallet.

Upon configuring your Skywallet, it will be listed in the Wallet list. The list can be viewed when you open your Desktop Wallet.

To personalize your Skywallet, connect your Skywallet via USB to your computer and then open the Desktop Wallet.

Once the Desktop Wallet is opened, click on the **Hardware Wallet** button in the Desktop Wallet window.

Once you click on the "Hardware Wallet" button, the following window will appear:

When you use the Skywallet for the first time, you will find two warnings associated with **Creating a Backup** and **Setting a Pin**, displayed in the Desktop Wallet window.

Both of these warnings are to be dealt with seriously, or it may compromise the security of your Skywallet.

To complete these two tasks, you can use the options in the Hardware Wallet window.

Following are the options available in this window:

=== "Create a backup"

    The Seed of your Skywallet is a key component. A Seed is the only way to access the coins stored in your Skywallet. 

    Once the initialization is complete, it is essential to backup this Seed and store it in a secure location.

    To backup the Seed of your Skywallet, click on the button **"Create a backup"**.

    Once you click the "Create a backup" button, a warning message will be displayed.

    After accepting this warning message, the Skywallet will start to display the words in your Seed one by one.

    ![Seed_2](img/Skywallet%20Screen%20Mockup%20Edit_Skywallet%20Black_05-2?raw=true)

    **You need to note down each of these words and store it in a secure location.**

    **You would have obtained a Seed card along with your Skywallet, we recommend you to use this Seed card to note down your Seed.** 

    **Note - Make sure that it is retrievable because if anything happens to your device, it will be impossible to retrieve your coins without the Seed.**

    After completing the display of the words in the Seed, the screen displays ***all the words in the Seed again***, so that you can verify your entries.

    **Note - After completing the Backup process, you cannot repeat the same. Hence it is essential to note the Seed down during this process. Once you have completed the backup process, the "Create a backup" button will be replaced by "Confirm Seed" button.**

=== "Create  PIN code"

    Creating a PIN code for your Skywallet enhances its security, as only a person with the PIN can access the device. 

    To create a PIN for your Skywallet for the first time, click on the button - **Create PIN code**

    Once you click on the button "Create PIN code" the following window will appear on the Desktop Wallet:

    ![Keypad to enter the PIN code](img/Personalization%20-%202.PNG?raw=true)

    <it is mentioned in the wiki page that the hash symbol which is currently used to mask the numbers in the keypad will be changed to dot if so then the latest version screenshot will be needed>

    Simultaneously a number Matrix will be displayed on your Skywallet display screen.

    <!--Picture of the Skywallet showing the number matrix-->

    To set the PIN, you have to use both the matrix as well as the Desktop Wallet window.

    **Each position of the number in the matrix corresponds to its position in the keypad shown by the Desktop Wallet window.**

    <!--A side by side picture of the two pictures mentioned above-->

    <!--An explanation of this side by side picture-->
    <!--The explanation can also be an edited image showing the correct position of the numbers in the masked keypad of the Desktop Wallet window-->

    Alternatively, you can utilize the number keypad on your computer for entering the PIN. 

    However, if you are using the number pad then note that **the position of the number in the matrix is what decides which number you are entering.**

    <!--An example comment using a single number on the position of the number keypad and the position of number in the matrix-->

    !!! note
        While setting up your PIN you have to enter it twice.

    After setting up your PIN, you can manage the PIN by changing or deleting the same. 

=== "Change the PIN code"

    Once you have created a PIN code, you can make modifications to your PIN code using the Hardware Wallet window.

    You can use the **Change PIN Code** option to change your current PIN code to a new one.

    Upon clicking the "Change PIN Code" button, the Hardware Wallet window will show you a keypad similar to the one you used to create the PIN code.

    ![Matrix](img/Skywallet%20Screen%20Mockup%20Edit_Skywallet%20Black_06.png?raw=true)
    
    ![Keypad to enter the PIN code](img/Personalization%20-%202.PNG?raw=true)

    You can enter the PIN code by utilizing the number matrix displayed by the Skywallet in the same way you used it for creating the PIN code.

    To change the PIN code, you have to enter the current PIN code first and then the new PIN code twice. 

=== "Delete the PIN code"

    Ideally, a Skywallet should always have a PIN code, and it is a recommended precaution to improve the security of your Skywallet.

    However, you can choose to delete the PIN code of your Skywallet using the Hardware Wallet window.

    To delete the PIN code of your Skywallet, you can click on the **Delete PIN Code** button. 

    After accepting the confirmation message, you will be asked to enter the PIN code of your Skywallet. Once entered and comfirmed, the PIN code of your Skywallet will be deleted.

    To ensure optimal security, please make sure to go through this section of the user manual - [Optimize account security](../07-optimizing-the-security)

=== "Wipe the device"

    **Wipe the device** button helps you to delete the data on your Skywallet.

    Once you click on the "Wipe the device" button, you will be asked to confirm the operation on both the Skywallet as well as Desktop Wallet.

    While confirming, note that there is an option to remove your Skywallet from the Wallet list in Desktop Wallet. By default, this option will be checked, and if not unchecked, your Skywallet will be removed from the Wallet list.

    !!! warning
        After confirming the warning message to wipe the device, **all the data in your Skywallet will be erased** except for the firmware updates.
    
    The firmware updates of your Skywallet cannot be deleted and will remain the same as before even after the deletion process.

    You can also restore all your coins by using the Seed of a previously configured Skywallet, details on how to restore your Skywallet are available on this section [Restore Backup](../06-restoring-backup).
