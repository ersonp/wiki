## Checking the Firmware

The Skywallet is built to provide maximum security to the user.

However, it is vital to check that your Skywallet is not compromised before using it.

=== "Step 1 - Connecting Your Skywallet"

    First, connect the Skywallet to your USB port.

=== "Step 2 - Checking the message on your Skywallet's Display"

    The display on your Skywallet shows one of the following three messages when connected via USB port, marking the authenticity of your Skywallet.

    === "Scenario 1"

        If the Skywallet is a genuine one and is being used for the first time, then the screen will display the following message:

        **Welcome!**

        **Please visit skycoin.com** 

        Along with the Skycoin Logo.

        ![Welcome_Message](img/Skywallet%20Screen%20Mockup%20Edit_Skywallet%20Black_03.png?raw=true)

        A Skywallet that is being used for the first time will not have a firmware installed.

        The firmware is the software interface which helps the hardware to interact with both the user as well as a computer. Thus without a firmware, your Skywallet will not work correctly.

        Any message apart from this welcome message implies that your Skywallet has been tampered with by a third party. Thus if you get any message apart from the welcome message, proceed to disconnect the device and contact support immediately.

    === "Scenario 2"

        A previously used Skywallet may have a firmware initialized, and if it has, then it might mean that it has been manipulated. Such a Skywallet will display the following message on its display screen:

        **Needs Seed!**

        Along with the Skycoin Logo.

        ![Needs_Seed](img/Skywallet%20Screen%20Mockup%20Edit_Skywallet%20Black_04.png?raw=true)

        If you get a "Needs Seed!" message on your first use, it means that your Skywallet is not a new one and has a firmware already initialized.

        !!! warning
            If you do get a Needs Seed! message on your first use of the Skywallet, refrain from using the device.<br>

    === "Scenario 3"

        The third and final message that might be displayed is a warning:

        **Unofficial Firmware Detected**

        such a message denote that the Skywallet is running on a firmware that is not approved by Skycoin. 

        !!! danger
            Do **not** use a Skywallet displaying that warning as the software version on your Skywallet might be corrupted, and it is ***unsafe*** to use the Skywallet, as using the said Skywallet could potentially make you lose your coins.
