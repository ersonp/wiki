# Updating the Firmware of your Skywallet

The firmware of your Skywallet is its user interface. A brand new Skywallet will not have a firmware installed.

Hence the first thing you have to do when you receive your Skywallet is to install the firmware. Once installed, the firmware of your Skywallet also needs periodic updates.

It is essential you do these updates; otherwise, you would not benefit from the latest security features and upgrades, ultimately putting your coins under risk of security threats.  
Also, at times, the firmware updates are made to improve the functionality of your Skywallet.

## Knowing when to Update

The Skywallet is designed to store your coins on a long term basis. However, it is essential to connect your Skywallet periodically to check for an available firmware update.

To check this, you can connect your Skywallet to your computer and open the Hardware Wallet window from the Desktop Wallet.

If your firmware is an outdated version then the following warning message will be displayed:
