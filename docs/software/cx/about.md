CX is Skycoin's original programming language. CX is a **general purpose programming language** that focuses on the design of distributed, blockchain-based applications. CX provides developers with high-level meta-programming features, such as **affordances**, **runtime stepping** and a **REPL** capable of modifying running programs at a low granularity level.<br>
CX is:

* deterministic
* integrates with blockchains
* works with immutable data structures
* incorporates our **new paradigm of affordances**
* is compiled and interpreted
* uses garbage collection
* has a strict typing system
* has other valuable tools built in

CX has multiple powerful libraries including **CXO** for immutable objects sharing, **CXFX** for its graphics engine, and more being developed. CX is written with Go's syntax to ensure professionals can quickly switch over and newcomers can easily learn it. CX will eventually be written entirely in CX.

Here you find a collection of all the knowledge you need to start with CX.<br>
