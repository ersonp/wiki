## What is Skywire?

Skywire is the next evolutionary step in the Internet's development and use. We want to break the choke-hold that Internet service providers (ISPs) have on the market by giving the power back to the  people. We are doing this by providing a decentralized community-driven mesh network where users themselves will own and control the networkâ€™s infrastructure. Our goal is to provide everyone with access to fast, secure, private and reliable Internet.<br>
It is time to leave ISPs as a relic of the past. Customers routinely have their browsing data tracked, stored  and sold by ISPs, and at the same time experience unreliable coverage and poor customer service.  Instead of relying on corporate-owned networks, the Skywire mesh network runs on widespread  user-owned nodes which come together to provide the infrastructure for the network, allowing  communities to power their internet access.<br>
Skywire is an incentivized meshnet and darknet which runs on a dedicated hardware backbone of official Skyminers containing proprietary technologies and DIY Skyminers made of consumer-grade hardware which can be bought off the shelf from around the globe at widely affordable rates.<br> 
Skywire acts as a truly secure VPN and SOCKS5 proxy which can also connect to the legacy Internet. It circumvents the corrupt ISPs, telecoms, and government services which spy upon our internet traffic to sell our data to each other or worse. The meshnet of Skyminers allows users Skywire to financially profit by transmitting one another's encrypted traffic data in exchange for $SCH Coin Hours. Selling your unused bandwidth acts as a new form of passive income. Skywire is also the first bandwidth market in history. It is additionally hardware agnostic so users can profit from running it on any system with the computational capability of doing so.
Skywire is the new Internet. It is making online life safer, faster, and more profitable for users than ever before.
