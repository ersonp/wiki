# Whitlisting System User Guide

## Introduction
The Skywire whitelisting system is designed to be used for managing whitelist applications and submitted user data.<br>

<div align="center">
<b>
Usage of the Skywire Whitelisting System is required to be eligible for testnet rewards.
</b>
</div>
<br>

Using the system requires a verified user account created in the [Skywire authentication system](https://auth.skycoin.com), please check out the [Skywire authentication system user guide](authentication.md) in case you need help with creating a user account.
 
<div align="center">
<em>Disclaimer: Previous data records, submitted via skycoin.com/whitelist were imported into the new system. You were informed to verify your imported data, please do so immediately if you haven't done that already.<br><br>
<u>Important note for people that had a DIY miner and an official miner in the old mikecrm system:</u> you will only get to keep one Skycoin wallet reward address in the whitelisting system. Please refer to the <a href="#usage">usage</a> section of this guide in case you need help with changing your Skycoin wallet reward address.
</em>
</div>
<br>

Please check out the [Functional Overview](#functional-overview) section for a brief overview of the currently available functions of the Skywire whitelisting system.

## Functional Overview
The following is a brief summary of the current functionality of the Skywire whitelisting system.

### Whitelist Application Submission
The Skywire whitelisting system enables you to manage your whitelist applications with ease:
- <u>submit new whitelist applications by using the Skywire whitelist application form.</u>
- review the status of your application at any time.
- receive status update notifications via email.

### Review and Management
The Skywire whitelisting system provides you the option to review your currently registered data records:
- the registered Skycoin wallet reward address.
- the registered public keys associated with your miners.
- <u>the uptime of your registered public keys.</u>

In case any of these data records are outdated, you are able to change them:
- <u>change your registered Skycoin wallet reward address.</u>
- <u>remove or change your registered public keys.</u>

Adding more boards is now easier than ever:
- upgrade whitelisted miners by adding more boards

Also, you are able to transfer your whitelisted miners to other user accounts if necessary.

### Email Notifications
The Skywire Whitelisting System contacts its user via several notification emails that are intended to make sure that people meet the requirements for being rewarded. 

#### Missed Uptime Requirement
Whenever the nodes of a user miss the uptime requirement, the Skywire Whitelisting System will send him a notification on the first of the subsequent month to make sure he's aware of the situation and can take appropriate measures.

#### Missing Skycoin Address
User accounts that do not have a valid Skycoin wallet reward address registered will receive notification emails five (5) days prior to the end of the month. These notification emails include information about how to add a Skycoin wallet reward address to a Skywire Whitelisting System user account.

<div align="center">
<u>More features will be added from time to time!</u>
</div>
<br>

### Account Creation
Please refer to the [Skywire authentication system user guide](authentication.md) in case you need help with creating a user account in the [Skywire authentication system](https://auth.skycoin.com).

<div align="center"><strong><u>Using the Skywire whitelisting system requires a verified Skywire authentication system user account.</strong></u><br><br>
<em>In case you were a participant of the testnet prior to the launch of the Skywire whitelisting system</em>, i.e. you submitted a Skywire testnet application using the form previously hosted at skycoin.com/whitelist, <em>you already have an account waiting for you.</em><br><br>
</div>
<br>
<div>
We imported all existing data records into the Skywire whitelisting system. You just have to assign your personal password and verify your account. <br>Detailed instructions were sent to your email address after the launch but they can be requested from support in case you lost them:

## Whitelist Application Management

<div align="center"><b>Official Skyminer cannot be created via the application form. Please contact support if you need guidance with registering your official Skyminer.</b></div>

The following section will guide you on how to submit a DIY application. Submitted whitelist application data must comply with the [Skywire mainnet rules](rules.md) and meet the [requirements](rules.md#the-form).

<div align="center"><em>Please note that manually opening a new application always results in the creation of a new miner. In case you simply want to add public keys/more boards to an already approved miner, please refer to the <a href="#auto-application-creation">Auto-Application Creation</a> section and the <a href="#modify-public-keys">Modify Public Keys</a> section for detailed instructions how to add more public keys/boards to your miner.</em>
</div>
<br>

* <b>Please log in to the <a href="#first-login">Skywire whitelisting system</a> and visit the <code>Whitelist Form</code> page by using the menu bar on the left:</b>

![wlist_application_empty](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_empty.png)


* <b>Enter the details of your whitelist application:</b>
   - public keys (click on the plus to add more public keys)
   - three pictures, each taken from a different angle
   - location
   - description

![whitelisting_application_text_filled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_text_filled.png)

* <b>Click on <code>UPLOAD FILES</code> to upload your pictures:</b>

![whitelisting_application_example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_completely_filled.png)

* <b>Double check your data and click on <code>SUBMIT</code> to submit your application:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/whitelisting_application_submitted_popup.png"
          alt="The popup indicating that the application was correctly submitted." />
<br>
<p>
This popup will show up if your application was correctly submitted.
</p>
</div>

* <b>Your application status will be <code>Application pending</code>. 

![whitelisting_actual_application](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_pending.png)


* <b>Your application will be reviewed by an admin. The waiting period is approximately a couple days, up to a week. You will receive status update emails as soon as the status of your application changes.</b>

Please follow up with the sections [Application DECLINED](#application-declined) and [Application DISABLED](#application-disabled) in case your application gets <em>NOT</em> approved on the first time.

### Application APPROVED
In case your application was `APPROVED` you will find an approved DIY miner one the `Miners` page:

![wlist_miners](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_miners.png)

Please refer to the [Review Data](#review-data) or [Change Data](#change-data) section in case you want to review or change your data.

### Application DECLINED
In case your application was `DECLINED` it means you have missed some of the requirements listed in the [Skywire mainnet rules article](rules.md).
<div align="center"><em>Any interaction with your application triggers email notifications being sent that update you on the status update and include a comment made by the admin that reviewed your application. Make sure to check your emails regularly!</em>
</div>

In case your application was `DECLINED`, your application form will look like the following:

![whitelisting_application_declined](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_declined.png)

* <b><u>As long as your application was<code>DECLINED</code> and not <code>DISABLED</code> you are able to resubmit the form to fix any flaws.</u> Please refer to the <a href="#application-disabled">Application DISABLED</a> section in case your application was disabled.</b>

![whitelisting_application_declined_fixed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_declined_fixed.png)

***
### Application DISABLED
In case your application was `DISABLED` you won't see an empty whitelist application form in the system. You have to check your emails to see the information about your `DISABLED` application. 
Once an application was `DISABLED` it's the best practice to contact support at [store.skycoin.net/pages/support](https://store.skycoin.net/pages/support) if you want to resolve your issue.

User accounts that had one of their applications `DISABLED` are still able to open new applications. Only serious rule violations and misdeeds will lead to having your account disabled and losing any eligibility to receive rewards.

### Auto-Application Creation
Adding public keys to your miner must be done by using the edit miner function outlined in the [Modify Public Keys](#modify-public-keys) section.
An automated application is being created in case you surpass the approved public key quantity of your miner thus requiring further approvement by an admin:

<div align="center">
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_miner_overview_change_added_popup.png" alt="Empty cell for new and additional public key." />
</div><br>

The previous state of the miner remains active and ready to receive rewards without the additional public keys. Simply exchanging your currently registered public keys does not trigger the creation of an automated application.

<em>Any open application will be put in the background and on hold until the automated application was approved by an admin. Once that's done your previously open application will be restored into it's previous state.</em>

If you did increase your public key quantity and the automated application was created for you, you have to submit new pictures that display the new boards you would like to add. 

Please visit the `Whitelist Form` page where you can review the automated application that was created for you:

![wlist_application_auto_whitelist_form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_auto_whitelist_form.png)

Please add the new pictures by using the blue <code>UPLOAD FILES (MINIMUM THREE PICTURES)</code> button:

![wlist_application_auto_whitelist_form_filled](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_auto_whitelist_form_filled.png)

Confirm your changes by using the blue <code>SUBMIT</code> button:

![wlist_application_auto_pending](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_auto_pending.png)

Your application will be reviewed and you will receive an email notification as soon as the status of your application changes.

Once your application was approved you will be able to review the added public keys in the miner overview page: 

*Please refer to the [Review Public Keys](#review-public-keys) section for detailed instructions how to review your currently registered public keys.*

![wlist_application_auto_confirmed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Asgaror/skywire/binary_data_storage/pictures/whitelisting_system/wlist_application_auto_confirmed.png)

## Manage Registered Data
The following section will outline the steps to review your currently registered data and change it if necessary.
Any steps that interact with miner data (public keys) require a whitelisted miner, created by an approved application.
Reviewing and modifying the Skycoin wallet reward address is possible regardless if your account is associated with a whitelisted miner.
